I haven't used one in several years but had a small, short move this go around so picked this peach up. Not surprisingly the truck was old but I was a little surprised by just how dirty it was. The person renting me the truck said ""Budget doesn't wash their trucks."" I guess it doesn't really matter but this looked like it hadn't been washed in ages. This unit had been through it, there wasn't a square foot of the truck that didn't have dents and scratches and everything in the inside was basically falling apart. You know, all of this is aesthetic, but the rear view mirrors being held together with clear packing tape was pretty bad. None of this really gives you confidence as you're about to ford through the 405. After pulling out of the lot the tire low pressure gauge came on which sounds par for the course and gave me hope that at least the trouble lights were actually working. But you know what? The old thing did the trick and got me 200 miles down the road so I figure this was pretty average? I'd have felt safer in something newer but the objective of the move was achieved. Don't forget to fold those moving blankets if you rent them.

And the cab was large enough to hold my 36 inch puppy crate and my two cats and me along with our overnight stuff. The pickup guy was a bit grumpy, but that was Bob. The drop off lady was cheery. I chose Budget because of the AARP discount AND the $10/day insurance available on pickup. This is the best deal I've found for those that qualify for AARP.

When I called them, they said it could take up to 2 hours for them to get back to me. I had movers coming in minutes and had no truck for them to pack. Ended up calling Uhaul who saved the day, and had a truck available for me. Don't bother with Budget, just call Uhaul.",,,,

The individual drop off and pick up locations were awful too!!! The pickup location the guy opened over an hour late (called corporate they said they couldn't do anything about it), which made us have to pay for movers who had nothing to do, and also got us on the road late, so we have to pay for movers for over an hour and a half who were at our house waiting on us. Then drop, we followed corporate's instructions, and the location tried to bill us ""drop off fees,"" and gas fees. Thank God we had proof that we filled the tanks all the way full because we ended up having to fight them on it, but we had all our recipets. They said ""oh the gas gauge is reading incorrectly.""

I had already booked help with loading and unloading in two different cities. Budge told me this a problem for them because they don't have enough trucks to stock the Dallas/Ft. Worth area and none of their locations had any trucks. If you are on a schedule and don't have flexibility in your moving plans and you live in the DFW area, DO NOT use Budget. I saw a similar review but had hoped it was a random thing. Apparently not. Thank goodness for U-Haul at the last minute on a Friday evening!!!",90.0,180.0,2.0,1200.0
Budget,Dawn H,Savage,MN,2017-07-15,1,Budget gave us a truck that was not road worthy. There was so much damage to it that the agent just circled the whole truck saying with damage. The truck had no AC (which was horrible since we moved from MN to GA); the window crank was busted; the truck lost all power 3 times while trying to go up hill which put us in danger stranded in the breakdown lane. The truck was decommissioned when we dropped it off at our destination it was in such bad shape. You would think they would do just as good or if not better inspection on their trucks as they do on their cars.,950.0,1900.0,2.0,3113.0

Budget,Lane P,Carlsbad,CA,2017-07-04,2,"I would not use the Budget rental in Vista again. The owner/operator did not bother to properly check out or check in the truck. I filled the truck with 3.5 gallons of gas when I returned it and he checked me out asking if I had returned it full, which it was, and then called me about an hour later saying he had gone to move the truck and thought the gas was low so instead of him charging me through Budget I needed to just stop back in and give him $10 cash. I told him I intended to contact him anyway because the bill I received listed two days of Liability coverage at $35/day when I had made sure I declined all coverages for the truck. The rental of the truck was $15/day and the mileage was $31 so the liability totaled more than the rental of the actual truck. Once I pointed this out to him he got a little anxious and said ""Oh, let's just call it even"" and wanted to get off the phone. If I wasn't so buried in the middle of a move and selling my home I would pursue it further to get my $70 back from Budget but I have a strong feeling that the coverages are added to customers bills at this location frequently.

When we arrived to pick up our reservation, the tow dolly had not been delivered and we had to wait an extra two hours before receiving it. The truck was the perfect size to fit all of our belongings so no problems whatsoever there. The problem began when Budget told us that the dolly would work with our vehicle; it did not. On the way out of town, the tire straps on the dolly broke. After calling the Budget 800 number desperately pleading for help -- they told us our only option was drive our fully packed moving truck 4 hours out of our way to get a replacement; they would not deliver it to our location. We had no choice, so we did. The Budget dealer set the carrier up to the moving truck and we headed back to where we left our vehicle. By the time we arrived back to the location where our vehicle was, we had lost an entire day and spent the night in the same town we were initially moving from. We had to contact local movers, rentals, hotels, etc. to reschedule everything we had set up months before in advance. Upon arrival to our destination, the Budget dealer performed the return inspection and noticed that the previous Budget dealer had given us a severely bent car carrier that was not safe to drive across country. Luckily, we made it safely. However, our pocketbook didn't reflect the same luck.

They also required us to drop the truck back off at the far away location, a day earlier than planned and charged for those extra miles. To top it off, the truck broke down on the way back and we had to have it towed.

I planned on making two, 4-mile trips between houses and the actual volume was about what I had estimated for a 3 bedroom house. The truck was in good condition despite the long gouge the previous renter had made along the passenger side of the truck, but the damage was well documented by Budget before I took possession. The main reason I chose Budget was because they rented trucks (non-commercial) that had lift gates. I was most surprised and happy to see that the vehicle also had an operational ramp that saved me hours of moving time because I only used the lift gate for my heavy items. The second reason I used this particular location was because of the proximity to my houses; only about 10 miles round-trip. I especially liked the thorough operational walkthrough that Budget gave me when I picked up the truck. They even went so far as to direct me to the nearest gas station that sold the special diesel fuel I would need upon return of the vehicle. The only problem encountered during pick-up and drop-off was the extremely long wait time for their antiquated computer system to locate and print out the contract and receipt, but I enjoyed talking with the employees while I waited for the computer to respond.

Arrived at the pickup location at the appointed time, NO TRUCK! Don't know why? The agent called around and found a truck 90 miles away, but we would have to drive there to pick it up, they would not deliver it! We cancelled on the spot, went with Penske, who had a truck available, thank God. We had crews set up on both ends of our move and any delay would have cost us extra money because of Budget. Tried calling Budget's 800 number to complain, but only got a peon who works weekends, no supervisor, so no help there. Emailed them, explaining the situation and asking for the difference in cost, because we had to rent on the spot with Penske, no discount.

I ended up finding another Budget nearby who had a 16 ft truck, but not the pads or dolly, and who did not honor the original agreement so had to spend an add'l $150. I bought pads spending another $100. The truck itself was good, and the move went smoothly. Until several days after arrival in TPA when I noticed a $50 ""no show"" fee from Budget.

Budget,Helen G,Silver Spring,MD,2014-07-15,3,"We had used Budget in the past, and had found their prices reasonable, and their service better than some of their competitors, but this time they were a big disappointment. We had made our reservation a month in advance, and were supposed to pick up the truck from a liquor/convenience store/Budget location at 9 am. Due to various delays, we showed up at 9:30, but the place wasn't even open yet! We gave Budget a call and let them know, and decided to wait around because their sign said they would open at 10. In the meantime, we decided to walk around the place and see if we could find the truck and get an idea of whether or not it would need a through checking-over. We walked around the entire property, and the only trucks we saw were 16 footers, not the 24 footer we had reserved. When the place finally opened, the man said that he did not have a 24 footer available, and that they had all been rented a few days before and he had not gotten any back. He offered us a 16 footer (which, in retrospect, we probably could have managed with, but we didn't expect our movers to be so awesome at packing the truck! :) ). He called around and eventually sent us to another location about 10 miles away, where we got a 24 footer that was in functional, but not great condition. The truck itself was a bit beat up, and there were a couple of holes in the floor and ceiling, each about 8 inches in diameter, and we had hoped to have a ramp at the back, but wound up with a platform. We had also reserved 24 furniture pads, but the man at the new place only had 6. He and the man at the first place said something about giving us a discount for the inconvenience, but we're not entirely sure if that actually happened or how much it might have amounted to. If it did indeed happen, I expect that the discount would have been 15-20% - which isn't too bad. On the whole, I believe that most of the problems were caused by the man at the first location - he should have been aware of our reservation and been in charge of having it ready - but I also think that if Budget communicated better with the people at its locations and simply had a better organizational system, that most of these problems could have been avoided.",40.0,170.0,4.25,1100.0

Basically, someone lost the original cap and replaced it with one that did not fit the particular truck. The cost to rent this truck was definitely not worth the money. I was charged for a certain number of miles whether I used the maximum miles allowed or not and even though I returned the truck earlier than planned the cost remained the same. The pick-up Budget Representative specifically told me I would need to top off the gas because the needle in the truck would not register a full tank otherwise and I would be charged for not filling up the tank.

So they were scrambling that morning to find me a truck as I had people from Full House Family Moving scheduled for noon that day and had made advance reservations, some pre-paid, for moving my things from NH to FL and planned to leave at 1 a.m. on the 31st. They finally found one 2 hours away in VT and sent guys to bring it back, but that means postponing the movers who thankfully were able to accommodate me. However, the truck Penske finally provided was a 2019 brand new model with only 4000 miles on it!!

The 2 year old 26ft we used in 2016 much much much better. Suggest eliminating the hydraulic bouncy seat! Another BAD! We didn't get our 1st of two 26ft trucks until 4 hours later. (12:30pm versus 0830!) We also didn't get the blankets or hand truck we ordered. Had to drive to another Penske location to get these myself. Finally, the truck came with <1/4 tank of DEF. for the 1000-mile trip, meant I had to get off the road & find/buy DEF from AutoZone. Saving grace? GOOD!: The manager at DC store (""Matt"") went well out of his way to try to make sure things worked. He also credited us funds back for all the waiting around, lack of reserved equipment, and having top go to retrieve equipment that should been on truck #1 (which at reserved 0830 tie, was full of garbage & pallets!) He (Matt, manager New York Ave DC store) called 3-4x to have hand truck and blankets in the later truck (arrived 1230PM versus reserved 0930). 1st truck I took off with had the carrier, was suppose to be truck #2. CHAOS!: With movers waiting on us, had to drive the wrong one home first, disconnect the carrier, and try to get the loading started.

Penske,Lawana R,Pompano Beach,FL,2018-03-17,5,"It's something for me to be able to say excellent, when in fact we experienced a truck exhaust issue. But please allow me to finish, because, we were so tired after packing and loading this huge 26' rig. The rig was clean and gassed up ready for me. It took us 20 hours to pack and load, we slept at a motel for a while, prior to heading down the road, toward our new home. We got off to a late start, because we slept in, due to the extremely long load day. In the pitch black darkness of night, about 400 miles down the road, we experienced a malfunction which required us to pull the rig off of the road, to the right shoulder. Though it was in the middle of the night, the highway was packed with 18 wheeler traffic. The rigs flew past our parked truck making it sway back and forth like a ship in the rolling sea. I phoned the 1800 # on my contract...granted, I was a little ""miffed"" at the situation, however, the really assuring voice on the other line, immediately began to reassure me that they would take care of us, then began a remote, computerized analysis of the situation...which took about 20 minutes from the beginning of the call to their completion of a diagnosis. They ordered a repair man to come to our location, about 50 miles between cities. They made sure that the highway patrole was asked to drive by for a welfare check, and to make sure that we had pulled far enough from the traffic to be In a safe place. The highway patrole arrived and assisted me in moving the truck further off to the right. ( I had been hesitant, because the truck was so heavy, that I was afraid of finding a soft shoulder, and concerned about having the tires stuck in soft dirt). After helping me move the rig, the officer stayed in the center island of the highway with his lights on, to make us feel more secure. Though it took about 1.5 hours for the repair man to arrive, Pensky had taken the time to call me twice during my wait time to assure me and to check on me. When the young may arrived, he was so understanding of our situation, and as well as he began to diagnose the issue, he offered us a bottle of cold water, and cared about our welfare. After he found the problem, he said that he would be able to fix it, but it would take about 45 minutes to 1.5 hours. He told us to take that time to rest if we could, or at least relax for a while. It did take just over one hour to repair the issue, but he not only assured us, with caring reassuring words, Pensky also offered to have our truck towed to a quieter area further up the highway while waiting for the repair man to arrive, bye-the-way. They also told me that if our truck could not be safely returned to service, they (Pensky) would have our goods removed from the ""broken rig "" and loaded into a different rig to complete our move, if necessary. Though it was not the most comfortable situation to go through, Pensky, not only compensated me financially for the inconvenience, they made sure we had the ability to get a motel for the rest of the night, instead, of continuing on our journey, after being delayed, making our tiredness an unsafe condition in which to travel. I will most assuredly use Pensky again when I need equipment to move anything again. They not only took care of me at every stage, they truly showed me how much they cared about me personally, and my family as well. A young man named Andrew in the Corporate office spoke with me twice to make sure we had been cared for properly. Thank you Pensky, L.L. REYNOLDS, Valdosta, Georgia.",550.0,600.0,1.09,1600.0

Penske,Theresa S,Sidney,NY,2017-11-11,4,"We were in contract to have three movers for three hours. Only two movers showed up. This proved to be more expensive for me and my husband. The reason we had requested three men was because we had some heavy items, a roll top desk I estimate at four hundred pounds. The antique desk had a top that lifted off so it made moving easier. The two moving men dropped the dos of the desk while carrying it down the stairs, breaking the roll top desk top in many pieces, and chipping all the stairs as it went down. Thank goodness none of the men were injured. The two men were nice, and did get the rest of our stuff on the 26 ft. truck without incident. My husband and I drove very slowly to our destination in Virginia from New York. There was almost no damage to anything in the truck. So overall we are thankful that the trip was a success. I think that there would have been no damage to our desk if they had sent three men instead of two. The billing didn't seem fair, we were charged for 2 men for 2 hrs plus 6 additional hours (a total of 16 hrs.). It was unfair because we had been in contract for 3 men for 3 hrs. With an 2 additional hours and 20 minutes by 3 men (to equal a total of 16 hrs.) the bill would have been lower. We were billed $730 (with an $85 adjustment credit to us), instead of the original $370 we had agreed to, plus $95 for each additional hour would have totaled $607.50.

She was not friendly, and didn't look at the order and missed getting my packing blankets and dolly loaded until I remembered it and said something. She had an attitude when I didn't want to sign off on the damage on the truck without seeing it first. She also assured me that the return location information was in the packet she handed me and it was NOT. She didn't act like she liked her job much. She mentioned some extra insurance to me that was apparently beyond the initial insurance that I took, and said that the 3 different types of insurance were $7, $5, and $14 for 3 days. I questioned her about the charges for this several times and she said it was that price for 3 days. After she rang up the transaction, the bill came to way more than I expected and I questioned her. THEN she said that the insurance was a PER DAY charge for each, not for 3 days! Big difference! She did not apologize or seem phased by this at all or try to correct it. It seemed to take a bit long for her to check me out - and I rented U-Hauls for a long time, so I know it should go faster than that, especially since they had all my info from online. As I mentioned, the truck itself worked out great. The truck itself cost me $305 + insurances + dolly + 3 dozen packing blankets = $547",,305.0,,

Penske,Mary H,Conway,AR,2017-06-07,1,"Actually I would give a negative 5 rating if that were an option. I had difficulty from the beginning to the end of this move with Penske. I went to their office several times in Olive Branch, MS and there would be no one there. No note on the door...nothing, no one. I waited for 10 minutes the first trip and no one ever showed up. The truck pick-up was at a different location and I was not told that until I went to pick the truck up. It was difficult to find and when I did, you guessed it, no one was in the office. At least there was a number to call and a woman did show up. It took over an hour just to sign the papers and get the keys to the truck. The ""new"" girl had no clue what to do or how to do it. She had to call a number of times to find out how to enter the information. Finally, we went out to the truck and the three dozen blankets I had ordered with this truck were not in the truck. We stood outside in the heat while she went around in the back and gathered them up from different storage rentals. The blanks were smaller than usual and I swear, I could actually see through them when I held it up in the light. They were just big pieces of felt. The movers who loaded my Penske truck fortunately had some of their own blankets and loaned me several. When we finally got to our destination and tried to return the truck, there was no Penske at the location given by the Penske site. After several phone calls we figured out where it was; went there, and, yes, again, there was no one in the office in this town either. We had to make another trip a few hours later to get the truck returned. We had rented their tow dolly also. It took us two hours to figure out how to get the thing lined up and the car loaded. We did call the Olive Branch office to ask for some direction and, wait for it...no one answered. We left a message asking for a call back. Yes, we are still waiting. I would not recommend this company to anyone for anything. I would drag my furniture on my back before I tried to work with these folks again. What a work in frustration!!!

Penske,Kristyn S,Schaumburg,IL,2016-10-30,2,"I don't know if I would use Penske again for a cross country move. The price was reasonable but the truck did give us some headaches. When I originally ordered the truck I ordered a 22' truck, a trailer for our car and some furniture covers. When I got there they said they didn't have a 22' truck available and that the closest one was in another city that was nowhere near where we were. My husband asked what was the smallest they had. They told us 16', which would not be big enough. The next size they had was a 26' truck, which was more than enough. We didn't need that big of a size but that was all they had. I asked them why have someone order a specific truck size if it's not available they day they pick it up. The rep said it depends on when the people who rented it out brings it back. That sometimes they run behind and don't have it back when it is supposed to be. To me that's crap. As a business you should have in stock what people are requesting, not relying on the customer to have it brought back by a certain day. Things happen and the company should be prepared for that so they have what the customer asked for originally. Needless to say we wound up getting the 26' truck. We do the inspection and noted anything that was wrong. We get in the truck and drive to our building. Movers come and then it starts to rain. No much of a big deal, right? Well, come to find out there were two leaks in the cargo hold close to the front of the cab. It was the movers that told me about it. Keep in mind when we picked up the truck it wasn't raining so we wouldn't have known. As soon as they told me I called them to let them know. The told me to try and patch it up with duct tape. If that doesn't work then to bring it back and they would give us another truck. Well, that wouldn't work because the truck had already been partially loaded. Fortunately the tape had worked and stopped the leak but we'll see how our furniture held up when we get to California. We're going from one temperature to another and all kinds of weather climate. I took pictures to show proof in case our furniture did get damaged along the way. They did discount the cost for the leaks which was good. So we were on the road from Chicago to San Francisco which means we would be driving through the mountains. When we hit the first hill the speed limit dropped from 70 mph to 55 mph. To me that shouldn't happen. I gave it some time to see if it would continue. It did so on the 2nd day of driving I called to let them know the issue. The lady said that since we were trailing a car behind it can cause the truck to slow down. I found that interesting considering we were being passed by semis that were going uphill. Granted they are different but when I see a Fed Ex truck hauling 3 trailers pass us to me something isn't right. I could understand if we had a full truck but we had a 26' truck, which according to Penske's chart is meant to hold a 5-7 bedroom house. We only had a 2 bedroom condo so there shouldn't have been that much weight trailing behind. The rep said if we were still having issues to stop at a Penske store and have them look at it. Shortly after it seemed to do ok but we still have 250 miles to go and up a mountain. The other thing is that these trucks are gas guzzlers. These only take diesel and the tanks are big so it does get expenses. My husband and I are not satisfied with this truck at all. The reps were nice and they did try to help, but man, I wouldn't never use their trucks again.",2150.0,2500.0,1.16,1200.0

The truck itself did get the job done, a 1,300 mile move loaded completely. I would say the truck was in desperate need of maintenance though. It was advertised as having radio, USB, and aux. It didn't have USB, and neither the radio nor the aux jack were functional. The engine light came on about 900 miles in and never went away, apparently a problem with emissions.

Penske,Douglas G,Roswell,GA,2016-07-01,3,"We had a mostly positive experience. The AC in the truck sometimes struggled but it wasn't horrible. Also, we got stuck with performing the engine exhaust filter cleaning procedure. It wouldn't have been a huge deal but it requires the truck to be parked for 30 minutes while it automatically revs itself up to about 1500 rpm and just stays there. This burns a ton of diesel fuel; fuel that YOU the customer paid for. There's nothing about this in the rental agreement with Penske and I do not take lightly the fact that they are essentially having customers perform a maintenance procedure. Luckily Penske agreed to refund me $50 for the experience, which offset the wasted fuel cost. The 26' truck was fully loaded and pulled a 4'x8' trailer and it still managed to deal with all of the hills of the north Atlanta area suburbs. I don't think a Budget or U-Haul truck with a gasoline engine would have been able to cope with that.",800.0,1500.0,1.88,1550.0

Penske,Mark H,Forest Hill,MD,2016-06-11,5,"We rented a 26' trailer from Penske. We were traveling from Indiana to Maryland, one way was 615 miles. Each way took 12 hours to drive (regardless if I was doing 65 mph or 70mph) with very minimal stops to refuel or bathroom/snack break. I drove a total of 1845 miles. The truck was rented for a total of 7 days with 26 pads and a hand truck for a total cost around $1000-$1100. United Van Lines was the cheapest moving company of all the Big 3 and of several smaller companies like ""3 Men and a Truck"" (they were the most expensive believe it or not). United quoted us $10,000. The Penske truck ran flawlessly. It performed how I hoped it would (with no issues). We did have an issue with the roof of the truck leaking. There were several large holes in the roof of the truck. This of course was only noticed after we were loading the truck and a rain storm started. We called Penske and they sent a service man out to repair it. Since it rained all day, they could not get a good repair. The repair man covered the truck with a tarp and would come back when the rain stopped. Unfortunately, it rained for several days and I didn't want to wait. We covered the inside with a tarp and drove it to Maryland. After unloading in Maryland, the weather had finally cleared up. When I drove the truck back to Indiana for the second and last trip, the Penske repair man came to the house at 7pm Wednesday evening and put a permanent repair on the roof. Was this preventable by Penske? Probably not. There is no way to get on the roof to inspect it and they will only notice it if the customer complains about it. For us, I think they responded promptly. I would also recommend renting the hand truck. I wish I could buy that thing. It made moving any large object, no matter the weight, easy and quick. With the flip down bar on the bottom and the two securing straps, wow, what an invaluable piece of equipment!! This is the third time I have rented a Penske truck. Always the 26 footer. Very easy to drive. I would also recommend, buying a seat cushion to use on top of the drivers seat. Although its an air ride seat, the cushion was almost totally flat. The cushion really made a difference. Also, the truck has cruise control. But it is governed to a maximum speed of 65 mph. If you want to drive faster, you can. You just can't use the cruise control. The truck I rented also had an updated radio which was Greatly Appreciated. It had a USB charging port and an accessory port that we were able to listen to our music from our phone and audio book downloaded to our phone. It also had a CD player. Most new cars/trucks don't come with a CD player anymore, so that was a nice surprise. The truck also had 2 cigarette lighter plugs. We were able to keep all of our electronic devices nice and charged throughout the entire trip.",1845.0,1100.0,0.6,5000.0

In the end we were able to rent 60 pads- the rental location didn't have extra -- and we could have used probably another dozen or two dozen-- pads are worth it since they are protecting everything.,1300.0,1600.0,1.23,1500.0

I got the truck at 11am, when my timing and moving crew timing was tight already (added 3 hours to the day of loading, since I had to pick up items north of Atlanta and had to do so in the peak evening traffic because of the delay)!

I now know how to drive a 26 ft truck, with a tow, caring my BMW, park, back up, hook and unhook the tow, just genius. A pain at times, but it got me from Texas to Atlanta approximately 900 miles, and me, my sons, my personal belongings, and my vehicle all got here in one piece at the same time with zero damage. I would recommend Penske over Uhaul.

The truck was a beast and handled well for the entire 1800 mile journey. We got a 22' truck for a heavily furnished 2 bedroom apartment and the movers packed and loaded it with room to spare.

Penske,David O,Polk City,FL,2015-04-05,2,"I initially reserved a 22ft box truck. The week before our move their district office (Mobile, AL) called me and asked if I would consider a 26ft, power lift-gate truck - they needed to get this truck to the Orlando, FL area (we were moving near there) in the worst way. I told them that as long as it didn't cost more I would be okay with that. In hindsight, I should have asked for a reduced rate because using a lift-gate - instead of a ramp - it takes MUCH longer to load and unload the truck. As it turns out, I had to pay my ""helpers"" $100 more because of the extra time it took to load the truck. Also, because of a ""screen"" that is installed at the bottom of the neck of the gas tank, it is difficult to fill the tank with fuel. I saw diesel in the neck of the fuel tank before I turned the truck in, but the fuel gauge only read 7/8th full. The office I returned the truck to was going to charge me over $70 for fuel (at $8/gallon I might add) until I raised such a stink that they gave me a ""customer satisfaction refund.""

I never worried that the truck would break down over any mountain passes (I heard terrible moving stories about cross-country drives - yikes).

The only issue we had was that thy confirmed the day before that they had a truck 6 miles from our new location in Ocean Isle and when we went to pick up the truck they said we had to drive 40 miles out of our way to pick up the truck in Myrtle Beach. That was bad. That added 80 miles onto our trip that day. With 1300 miles facing us we really didn't need an added 80 miles.

Penske,Jonathan P,Dallas,TX,2014-09-02,3,"Penske sucks. They tried charging me a rate I never had agreed to during the online reservation. They have a guarantee that the truck would be ready when reserved online however the truck was an hour late. Plus it took another hour and a half to get out the Home Depot office as they tried to ""fix"" the pricing issue before I left with the truck. Meanwhile I was paying for movers that were unable to work as I had not showed up with the truck yet. Home Depot doesn't know how to rent Penske's so do yourself a favor if you are tight on time... skip Penske @ Home Depot, reservation or not. I was very displeased with their service and inability to get me checked out so I can begin my move. The truck worked fine however it was just a huge timely hassle to actually check out the truck after I had reserved a week in advance online.

Penske,Mike V,Cape Coral,FL,2014-07-28,5,The agent at the pick up location was very knowledgeable & helped me to understand several aspects about the truck & car carrier that I was renting. The truck ran well & I had no problems. Just make sure that if you park in a Hotel for the night that you give yourself enough room to get out in the morning because some people will block you in without thinking about it. Make sure you stop at a fuel station that has enough room to get in and out. Pilot & Love's are good stations for truckers. The agent was helpful at the drop off point & helped me to unhook the car carrier. I will definitely use Penske if I need to rent another truck in the future.

Never had this kind acceleration problem before...even on flat, could not get over 71mph. Yes, generally plenty fast and most often the posted speed limit, but there are always times when you should be able to apply accelerator and actually accelerate.",,,,
Penske,Rudolph H,Savannah,GA,2014-05-04,4,"I was misinformed when I reserved the truck as to what the charge was for each day the truck was returned late. I was told $50 per day. However, that was the rate for returning the truck beyond the contracted terms and if paid in advance. If you return a truck later than the number of days you initially paid for, the daily rate jumps to $100. When I first contacted Penske, the rep curtly advised me to read the lease agreement. I told her it is about 30 pages long, in fine print and reads like stereo instructions. It was probably only about 10 pages long. She also advised me the time for return was exactly the time of checkout. I asked her shouldn't such important details be highlighted during reservation and checkout and require the customer's initiating. She said, ""I wouldn't know."" I called back and spoke to another rep, and he told me he understood my situation and made an adjustment to the lease allowing for the $50 per day late fee. Lesson here: if at first you don't succeed, try again and again until you get satisfaction. When I made the reservation, I was told that the truck WOULD be full of fuel when I picked it up, I was expected to bring it back full, or I'd be charged for completely filling the 50-gallon tank. I was aware of this from previous experience. When I picked up the truck at Home Depot, to my surprise, the fuel tank was 3/4 full. This was noted on the lease contract sheet. When I returned the truck I forgot about the amount of fuel I had when I checked out until I had put 7/8 of a tank of diesel fuel in the tank. When I returned the truck and pointed out how much fuel was in the truck's tank, the employee chuckled and said, ""If you put too much fuel in the tank, too bad, no refunds."" Lesson here: don't except any rental vehicle unless you are absolutely sure it is full of fuel. The next time I do so, I will take it to the nearest fuel station and top it off and get a receipt.",,,,

Penske,Jason K,Gonzales,LA,2014-04-27,3,"First truck broke down before I could leave Louisiana. Thankful for good friends who provided a place to stay. Unable to fix by roadside assistance, so drove to main Penske rental/service location. Cannot say enough about Nathan and Chris, they kept me informed. Evidently the truck had a history of break pressure issues, despite only 41000 miles. Four hours later, it was determined a new truck would need to be brought in and a crew to unload into a new truck. At 7:30 in the evening 12 hours from when I started I was finally on my way, but it was too late to start my journey west. Would use Penske again, truck was clean and the ride was much better than u-haul. A bigger discount off my rental would of been nice towards the 24 hour delay in getting to final destination.",,,,

Penske or the rental office, I don't know for sure which, was having computer problems so it took and hour to get rental agreement set. We did receive an additional discount because it took so much time to set up the rental. Once I got the truck and started driving it home, there was a low tire indicator that wouldn't go off. The local rental office met me at a filling station in route to my house to check it out and determined it was a faulty sensor. From then on things went smoothly. But it took almost 2 hours to rent the truck and check it out, and I ended up with my loading helpers waiting at the house. The return of the truck after our one way trip was a piece of cake.",,,,

It took me 2 tries with the email link, then I downloaded the app and finally was able to check in during the 3rd time through.

Also at least all the 26footer should be rented out with a quarter to a half of a tank of gas in them JUST to give the driver some time to get use to the feel of the size for awhile. Not all gas stations are roomy enough to squeeze that big baby in! Mad dash to the closest station I could find so I could top off the underground aquifer of a gas tank it holds. Half way through the drive after being fully loaded the oil change light came on and gave me a heart attack, before it finally registered it wasnt oil pressure! Woooo! A door noise that made me think the door wasnt fully closed, it had some character. But the engine noise and gas level is my gripe.

U-Haul,Spencer P,Vidor,TX,2017-06-29,3,"This was a 26' truck for a 2-bedroom apartment (largish apartment), but was way too big. Lots of leftover space when loaded, but ok. Uhaul changed the pickup location the evening before I went to my desired pickup location (at 7am) only to find out that the truck was at another dealer 7 miles away. They sent an email the previous night, but didn't call. I was busy packing not browsing through emails then, so I didn't see the change of venue. To his credit, the manager at the preferred store was cleaning out another truck for me to use, but I had already gotten on the phone to get a ride from the one location to the other and didn't hear him say he would to that for me. The official truck was a big ""screw you"" to whichever location got it. We did the walk-around, and the guy told me to note any locations with damage that weren't already marked with an ""X"". Well, there were several hundred X's on the truck if not more. There was one long scrape along the top edge on one side that wasn't marked, and we noted that. What I didn't see and he didn't remark about it was that the top of the truck was damaged and patched with aluminum tape, and that it would leak. Well, one rainy drive later, and I found water on my stuff. Luckily, we bagged the important and delicate stuff, but the road grime on it all wasn't too nice. I found his note on the backside of the form and his comment that I had been told about the patch. Nope. We also couldn't get into the yard of the receiving Uhaul dealer since they were not open at the time I was supposed to return the truck, but luckily there was a broken gate in the back and ultimately, we returned it ok, but not without lots of phone calls and ""I can't help you's"" from friendly staff and after-hours customer service agents. Anyway, all's well that ends well I suppose, and the move was fine, but lots of details were not very well handled. We usually do a Uhaul trailer, but our cars don't have trailer hitches now, so the big truck was our option both ways on this trip. We just picked them because we always seem to use Uhaul when we do it ourselves. An interesting tidbit: when booking online, pick a backwater drop-off location where Uhaul doesn't want to receive a truck after a one-way trip and they'll offer you a very good discount to drop it at a more reasonable location (one that you'll most likely prefer too).

Not too big of a deal until the charges were increased and not at the agreed upon price with the original booking person. The person at the pick up location was polite about it and had to call his supervisor to get the matter straightened out and the price corrected. Drop off was fine. Gentleman even called the car rental place for me. I didn't have any problems with the truck except one. With my bad knees it was hard to get up into the cab. Poor guy at the pick up location had to get a stepladder for me to use. I had to bring a step stool to use during my 6 hour trip and rely on the kindest of strangers to hand me the step stool once I got back in the cab. All rental truck companies might want to think about adding that extra step to these high cabs. Some of us aren't as young and flexible as we used to be.

I returned the truck to the original location, and had to see someone at the check in desk. Uhaul is getting 2 stars instead of 1 because the person checking me in gave me the more reasonable rate since I had the truck only for 6 hours and let me check the truck back in even though the return location had been changed.

U-Haul,Anna T,Los Angeles,CA,2016-12-04,1,"I rented a uHaul truck to move myself from SF to LA. I had a team on either end to help me load / unload. All went swimminglysave my ""guaranteed"" reservation with uHaul. Despite reserving a truck 1 week in advanceI received a call 3 hours before my scheduled pick up informing me that there was no 15' truck available in town. Instead, I would have to make my way (with no car!) to Berkeley for another truck, and then return across the Bay on Black Friday! Traffic much?! I am still working with uHaul on compensation for the broken reservation. To date, they granted me an additional 50 miles for the drive, 12 moving blankets and a dolly, but no financial compensation for the broken reservation. This mix up proved to be very costly, as the time lost cost me half a day of planned moving and I'm having to do it all over again in order to get the balance of my things down south. When coordinating a huge move across a state, with two sets of landlords, two moving teams and holiday traffic in two townsthere simply wasn't wiggle room for this type of blunder! My review of the customer service in this regard remains tbd as I'm still in-processbut essentially, I've simply been given a 1-800 to call and complain. :( Doesn't look good, uHaul!",450.0,650.0,1.44,1200.0

Neither was where it was supposed to be. Having already organized a moving crew, made hotel reservations at the other end AND had a closing to attend, this was a major problem. After much discussion, they were able to locate a truck and trailer that were just an hour away, but the whole mess added 4 hours (time that I didn't have) to the day and it had to come from the early part since the movers were on their schedule...

Employee wanted on one man finished and started talking to another employee about dry wall needing to be taken care of and then they went outside to see about truck and left myself and the woman in front who had been waiting over 30min. Unfortunately the workers lack of customer service was obvious. I had rented a26 foot the day before and even though info was on contract we were lead to believe by paying extra fee there would be no Che for mileage which wasn't true .we weren't told if we needed more time that it would be cheaper to have kept the truck a day or two instead of re renting and loosing time and more money.

Luckily I was not in a tunnel or bridge and was able to coast it over to the emergency lane(Mind you this was a 26ft truck) C) eventhough the customer service was nice, the hold time each time I called was over 30mins - too long. Good - A) they did extend my days with the truck at no addl. cost. B) when I did reach customer service they were nice and they did call back to check on my status. C) More importantly (I wish I could remember the Mech. name) The mech was Awesome, he literally followed me for a good 45 mins to make sure I was good before giving me the ok sign. Note he has driven 2 hours to get to me, and I was going in the opposite direction of him. Great Guy. He is the main reason they get a 4 star. (Move was from NJ to MD)",240.0,700.0,2.92,1200.0

I ordered a 21' truck from a place 3 blocks from my apartment and they called a week and advance and said the could not guarantee that truck and would give me a 15' truck and a trailer. I said ok. Then the day before the move I had someone call to confirm the truck at their location and it wasn't even near my house and then another place called to confirm the trailer that was even further. With hiring movers based the time of picking up the truck I knew those locations were not going to work. I call the reservation number and talked to a lady for almost 2 hours!!!!(i was put on hold numerous times for long periods of time) and she said she could not help me and if I wanted to cancel the reservations. Meanwhile, after getting frustrated, I had a friend next to me call a UHaul place somewhat near my place to see if they had a truck and trailer for one way travel....guess what? They sure did. The only reason why I gave the review 2 stars and not zero is because the gm at the uhaul place i called was amazing. He gave me the truck first to fill it up and then told me if I needed the trailer to come back and if not then he wouldn't charge me for it. He also gave me his cell phone number to text him for anything else. I would recommend everyone to call the uhaul place you want to book through rather than the reservation number.

For such a big company the customer assistance is very poor. On the positive side, the tracks are big and have a ramp and the pick up and drop off is easy.

It would have been nice to have had a diesel truck, as I spent twice as much on gasoline as I would have for diesel (the older truck was a real gas guzzler). I purchased the full insurance (recommended for long-distance moves - it was a dangerous trip due to road construction), added no noticeable damage to the truck, and so I did not encounter any additional charges. I strongly recommend checking the towed auto-transporter straps and hitch at EVERY refueling or whenever you encounter bucking (straps became loose due to altitude difference).",1450.0,,,

U-Haul,C. Devon I,Langley,WA,2015-08-03,2,"First I would like to say the Uhaul office I picked my truck up was wonderful! My problem is with getting the proper truck. I ordered over a month prior to my move. I could not get anyone to 'Confirm' a trucks availability until 2 days in advance. I would call weekly since I live on an island and was trying to rent locally vs. off island and ferry costs are ridiculous. When I did finally get confirmation on my truck availability at my desired location I could finally confirm the moving labor guys I had hired. When I picked up my truck, I was told they almost never had a 26 foot truck and their order showed a 20 foot had been ordered. I have numerous emails stating I had a 26 foot truck ordered. I had to make do and it luckily it was a local move. The truck I did receive was spotless clean and ran well. Check out was simple and I dropped off after hours. My only complaint is you cannot get a 'gauranteed' vehicle at gauranteed location which was nerve racking in planning. Then getting the wrong size truck did not allow for the move in the allotted time so it cost a lot more in labor. I am still moving small stuff in cars days later which would not be possible for most.

When I picked up the truck (a full hour south of where we requested pickup), the rep told me that he could not change the destination, only the regional office could. I called them, they told me to call the number on the contract. I called that number and was told that the original rep should have modified the destination prior to us signing the contract and there was nothing she could do. She recommended that I call another woman, named Patty to see if the altered destination charge could be waived. Party said she did not have the power to do so, and had no idea why anyone had given me her number. She recommended that I speak with the location that I wanted to drop the truck off. I called them, and was told there would be a fee, but they could not tell me how much until after I return the truck. I would have exceeded the mileage they offered me due to the pickup location and then driving to to the original drop off location, so I really wanted to do a comparison as to which way would cost less.

We reserved all equipment 3 weeks in advance. Two days before our move, a UHaul rep called us and said that there were no 26-foot vans available anywhere in northern Colorado. The other equipment was scattered throughout the northern half of the state and we would have to drive to many different locations (Longmont, Broomfield, Windsor, Fort Collins, and Northglenn) to pick it up. (We live in Loveland.) When we went to pick up the small van we were told that one of our trailer reservations had been cancelled. We did ultimately manage to get one 26-foot van (not two, as requested/reserved), but had insufficient room for all of our belongings and ended up having to leave patio furniture and an expensive, fairly new grill behind, at an estimated cost of about $1,000. We attempted to extend the time we would have all equipment since it took us 3 days to collect it all, but some locations weren't able to get the extensions to ""take"" in the computer and had to write hand-written notes on our contracts to extend the time, which of course was questioned when we returned the equipment.

I hadn't paid for the extra damage insurance when I took the truck. It didn't help that the temperature was about 104 at the time. One of the guys was going to refuse to accept the truck at all. It was really scary to me to be in such a fix. Fortunately the other guy decided to let me turn the truck in. On the plus side, when UHaul got back to me they only charged me for the damage to the truck I was driving which was about $80.

When I called to confirm it two days before my reservation I was told that they were not going to honor my reservation as they do not take reservations. I was upset as I was moving out of state and assumed when making the reservation and giving my credit card to reserve a vehicle would give me a vehicle. After numerous calls to customer service a vehicle was miraculously found. When I picked up the vehicle additional charges were not disclosed but at this point I had no other options. Dealing with customer service after the fact was a nightmare. The truck leaked and ruined my mattress and lost several boxes of books. Even with pics they basically said they couldn't help me.

They were impatient, rude, and disrespectful of my vehicle - when they needed me to move my car, they pounded on my window with a fist and tried to get in my car when someone was in the front passenger position which set off the alarm -- Unacceptable.

U-Haul,Dorothy C,Salem,OR,2014-07-17,1,"I will never use UHaul again! I rented a 26 ft truck and a 5x8 trailer. The trailer connection was not done correctly from the beginning and had to stop at 2 different Uhaul locations to connect the electrical properly. The truck was a really beat up truck. I asked if that was the best one we could get since we were travelling 3,000 miles. They assured me it was fine. The connection from the antifreeze hose to the radiator burst off because there was no clamp on the hose and we lost all antifreeze and water while in the dessert! This happened 2 times until we had to go 70 miles out of our way to get a set of clamps to fix the problem ourselves and also had to get more antifreeze. We called Uhaul and they said it would take hours for them to get to us while stranded in the hot dessert! And from the start, the power steering didn't work while trying to make turns. We called UHaul and they said they couldn't get to us for hours to fix the power steering, and we waited and they only replaced a belt, but that still didn't fix the power steering problem! At one stop at a UHaul center in ElPaso, I told the manager that I wish we had a different truck and he said that we could get another one but NEVER informed us that UHaul would pay to have my belongings transferred into another truck, which I found out they would pay this! Then in Pheonix, AZ, we stopped at another UHaul center with problems with the air conditioning and informed them of this but nothing was done. The whole trip was wrought with major problems which could have cost us loss of life or a horrific accident! Again, I will NEVER use UHaul, and hope others take heed to the horrific problems I had with using UHaul!!!...",3000.0,2859.0,0.95,2800.0

With all that done the pickup still wasn't smooth, mainly because there was only one person in the office to handle paperwork and get the trucks. She was very accommodating and apologetic but it took 45 mins for us to finally get the truck. I ended up leaving to go back home to meet the movers while my husband waited for the truck.

U-Haul,Shannon W,Laurel,MD,2014-04-24,3,"Once we got the truck it was a breeze. Getting there was a huge pain! I made the reservation online for a 17 ft truck for pick up at 9 am (movers were coming at 10 am). According to the online instructions, I was supposed to receive a call from a representative letting me know where to pick up the truck (I could only choose a preferred location online). I never received a call so I called on my own the day before the scheduled pick up. The representative informed me that the truck would not be available until noon. I told him that time did not work for me and that I needed it at 9 to be ready for my movers by 10. He made no effort to help me make other arrangements so I called another local Uhaul dealer (in Laurel MD) and spoke to Jonathan, who was able to get me a truck for 9 am pick up the next day with no problems. He saved the day! After that, pick up and drop off was a breeze. Would use Uhaul again but it seems like you're better off just calling your local dealer rather than trying to book online.",,,,
